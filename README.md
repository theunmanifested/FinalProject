# MangiaMici

## Final Project - Skill Distillery 28

This full stack application lets users us our friend-based restaurant review platform to share experiences with and about the people that you trust and already know. What's sets MangiaMici apart is the cherised and welcomed opinion of your friends restaurant experience (or that of people who's foodie point-of-view you can bank on). The problem that MagiaMici solves is getting quality reviews of restaurants/food that are of the same school of thought and palatte. This application uses Authentication/Authorization, performs CRUD operations, and is definitely pleasant to both look and use. Vai A Mangiare!
